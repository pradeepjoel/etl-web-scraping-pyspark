### Reflection & Next Steps
- Completed an end-to-end ETL pipeline with PySpark and SQLite, which reinforced data extraction, transformation, and loading concepts.
- Learned the importance of clean repository structure, reproducibility, and GitHub-ready project setup.
- Decided to apply these learnings to a new SQL-focused data warehouse project using PostgreSQL.
